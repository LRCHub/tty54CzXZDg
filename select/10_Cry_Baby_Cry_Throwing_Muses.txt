I wanna cry
On a roof
I - the third time
You will lose

He moved me
And the chains changed
I take a nervous face
Month after month after more
Mouth after mouth after her

I said a nightmare
Complete with barking dogs and coke machines
Keep feeling like a baby chicken
Keep touching life's basement

'I'm obvioulsy confused,' I said,
'I'm more more worried for you than for me'
I yell

Cry baby cry
Cry fight it
I'm not ever getting out
I'm always getting sicker

You're the person that took me
I found last September in a notebook
It was too much for the book to hold
That's how come I wore raincoats

I said first a suicide without a note
And now a note without a suicide
First a look without a note
And now a note without a suicide

She said 'maybe death is my answer,
But love is the answer of life'

He moved me and the chains changed
I take a nervous face
Month after month after more
Mouth after mouth after her

I said a nightmare
Complete with barking dogs and coke machines
Keep feeling like a baby chicken
Keep touching life's basement

Cry baby cry cry
I fight it
Im not ever getting out
I'm always getting sicker, sicker

I found last September in a notebook
It was too much for the book to hold
I lean on some

She said 'first a suicide without a note
And now a note without a suicide.'
I said 'maybe death is my answer,
But love is the answer of life.'
