Can't breathe,
Can't breathe,
Can't breathe,
Can't breathe,
Can't breathe
They don't know the creatures in my head
Somewhere between a life and freezing dead
It goes on and on, and on and on
On and on, and on and on
Somewhere between a life and freezing dead

It's a nightmare eating out of my eyes
Watch the blood drip down her thighs
My head just hurts turn off the light
Nightmare eating out of my eyes

There's no reason you and I are friends
There's no reason you and I are friends
There's no reason you and I are friends

It's a nightmare eating out of my eyes
Watch the blood drip down her thighs
My head just hurts turn off the light
Nightmare eating out of my eyes

Can't breathe,
Can't breathe,
Can't breathe,
Can't breathe,
Can't breathe
Can't breathe,
Can't breathe,
Can't breathe,
Can't breathe,
Can't breathe
